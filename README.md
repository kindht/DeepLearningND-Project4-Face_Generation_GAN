This is the 4th project for the **Deep Learning** Nanodegree program at [Udacity](https://cn.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101-cn-advanced)

The project built **GANs** (one Generator model and one Discriminator model) using **TensorFlow** and trained the models using **MNIST/CelebA** datasets to generate images showing **hand-written digits/human faces**


Here is the project file [Face_Generation_GAN-zh.ipynb](Face_Generation_GAN-zh.ipynb)

#### Example Noise image 
Genertor starts with this kind of image to gradually learn to generate images that look like 'real' images
